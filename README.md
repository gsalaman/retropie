## PS4 dualshock instructions:
Did this.  Works kinda with one with ds4drv....but second controller not so much.  Gonna try undoing this...

Yup...back to normal.  I think I need to be cabled.

## Spyhunter controls:
Left stick does back and forth.
Right trigger is accellerator.
Right bumper shifts from L to H
Square does machine guns
O does "accessories"

Options is coins
Select does middle steering button

So, if I wanted to build this:  
Driving wheel, with triggers on fingers and buttons on thumbs.
Accel pedal
Middle button for "start"
"coin" button.

## Tempest
spinner, 2 buttons:  fire, and super-zapper.  Cabinet had spinner right, fire on left (top), super-zapper below.

## Arkanoid
Spinner, one button...fire...but this one has that fire on both left and right

## Star Trek
Spinner, 4 buttons on right.  thrust and fire top and together.  warp below, closer to spinner...and then photons below thrust.  
Start by mapping thrust to l trigger, phasers to r trigger, warp to l bumper, photons to r bumper
