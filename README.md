## PS4 dualshock instructions:
Did this.  Works kinda with one with ds4drv....but second controller not so much.  Gonna try undoing this...

Yup...back to normal.  I think I need to be cabled.

## Spyhunter controls:
Left stick does back and forth.
Right trigger is accellerator.
Right bumper shifts from L to H
Square does machine guns
O does "accessories"

Options is coins
Select does middle steering button

So, if I wanted to build this:  
Driving wheel, with triggers on fingers and buttons on thumbs.
Accel pedal
Middle button for "start"
"coin" button.
